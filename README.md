## About
The repository contains all the code responsible for an university project developed for the subject called 'oficinas de integração'.

The project approaches the tetris game with increasing difficulty as the player evolves in the game, a start menu and a pause menu to show the current score.

The hardware we used in addition to the arduino was a tft 2.4 display. A 5-button keyboard and a buzzer for sound effects.

To create the code, the team followed a tutorial available at the link: https://javilop.com/gamedev/tetris-tutorial-in-c-platform-independent-focused-in-game-logic-for-beginners/
